  abstract = {We describe cell type-specific significance analysis of microarrays (csSAM) for analyzing differential gene expression for each cell type in a biological sample from microarray data and relative cell-type frequencies. First, we validated csSAM with predesigned mixtures and then applied it to whole-blood gene expression datasets from stable post-transplant kidney transplant recipients and those experiencing acute transplant rejection, which revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes that were otherwise undetectable.},

** Computational method to estimate cell-specfic differential expression between two groups of samples (using SAM). A number of other authors used it to successfully identified novel cell-driven disease signatures.},
